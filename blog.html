            <article class="">
                    <p>Yes. Because absolute units such as cm, mm, in,
                         pt and pc doesn't depend on the screen of the  user it is always the same.
                          And this way of designing website makes the 
                        website only usable for a specific screen size, the others like moblie will not be considered.
                    Relative units have nothing to do with the element itself rather it is dependant with the screen.Therefore, the element can be used for different screen with different size and orientation.

            <p class="title"> How does the browser interpret 200px when 16px is the default browser width? </p>
            <article class="">
                    <p>The value 200px is absolute and takes 200 units of the screen pixel.Using relative measurment units such as % would be different for example 200rem means 2 times the default font size meaning 2 * 16px which equals to 32px.</p>

            <p class="title">  Specific changes in CSS3</p>
            <article class="">
                    <p> There are quite a few new properties in CSS3.Below are some examples: </p>
                    <p>
                        Color: <br>
                         New way of describing color is introduced into CSS3. Color module, hexadecimal and rgb() was the only way to describe in previous version. In CSS3, the
                          color keyword list has been extended to include 147 additional keyword colors , and also provides us with a number of other options such as HSL, 
                          HSLA, and RGBA. These includes the ability to declare semitransparent colors. <br><br>
                         
                          New selectors: <br>
                          The evolution of selector:- In css1, id, class and element type was the only way. In CSS2, pseudo-elements, pseudo-classes, 
                          and combinators were introduced. Now, many selector types are added. <br> Example: 
                          nth-child, Element[attr^=val] ,Element[attr$=val] ... <br> <br>
                          Element[attr^=val]  <br>
                           Eg. a[href^=’https://piazza.com/.’]{color: green’} Matches any element E whose attribute a starts with the value https://piazza.com/ <br><br>

                          Element[attr*=val]
                          Eg.  img[src*=’gallery’]{border-color: #a7e7ec;}  This match element with img attribute having image source that contains 'gallery' in any of the part.
                          <br><br>

                          New layouts: <br>
                            Many new layouts are introduced in CSS3 that makes developing website easier and making it more apealing. <br><br>
                            Examples: <br> 
                            display: table; <br>
                            display: table-cell; This gives you a table layout without the HTML tables. <br>
                            display: flexbox;<br>
                            flex-order: 1; &emsp; With flexbox you have greater control over how the browser flows boxes, like divs onto the page. <br>
